			<h2>Weekend Events</h2>
            <p>At Briar Blossom, we believe in the magic of shared experiences. Our curated events are designed to inspire creativity, connection, and relaxation. From cozy evenings under the stars with our local astronomers to afternoon crafting workshops where you can create something beautiful with your hands, there’s always something to delight the senses. Many of these gatherings are hosted by talented members of the Fablewood City community, bringing a sense of local charm and artistry to each experience. All events are free for our guests, with select activities also open to the public for a deeper connection with the surrounding area. Whether you're here for a weekend getaway or a local resident, come and enjoy the magic of Briar Blossom’s events.</p>
